The Semi-cursive Script emerged in the Han Dynasty and was developed on the basis of the Regular Script. It is a writing system between regular script and cursive script, created to compensate for the slow writing speed of regular script and the illegibility of cursive script. The cursive script is slightly abbreviated where the strokes of characters can be visibly connected in writing, but not to the extent of the cursive script. This script ensures artistry while being readable and practical. There is a relative freedom of creation in the structure of the semi-cursive script characters, allowing the calligrapher to adjust the size of the script and the thickness of the strokes at his own discretion. Semi-cursive script’s ultimate aim is seeking harmony in the overall match of each character. Another characteristic of semi-cursive script is the connection of successive strokes, requiring a character to be written in an uninterrupted manner. One of the most famous Chinese calligraphers - Wang Xizhi - is famous for his work in semi-structure script - Preface to the Orchid Pavilion Collection.<br />
