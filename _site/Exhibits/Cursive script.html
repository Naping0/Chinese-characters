The cursive script was formed in the Han Dynasty. It evolved from the clerical script for ease of writing. The cursive script modifies, merges or even eliminates the strokes of Chinese characters, so that it can be written faster than any other Chinese script. However, it is difficult to read for those who are not familiar with its writing structure. It is used mainly as a shorthand or calligraphic style. People who can read Chinese in its standard or printed form may not be able to read cursive script, therefore, it cannot replace clerical script as the dominant script in the same way as regular script. The characters in cursive possess an abstract appearance and the characters frequently flow into one another. The characters are highly rounded and soft in appearance, lacking obvious angular lines. Cursive script is intended to feel graceful in a frenetic way. The cursive script places more importance on its artistry and the expression of the calligrapher’s emotions than on readability. The calligrapher Huai Su’s work - Huai Su’s Autobiography is one of the most representative works of cursive script.<br />
