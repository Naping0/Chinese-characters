The Regular Script evolved from the Clerical Script, and its structure and strokes became more simplified. It emerged in China between the Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period, gained dominance in the Southern and Northern Dynasties, and matured in the Tang Dynasty. It is also the most common style of modern Chinese writing and is the first script encountered by beginners of Chinese calligraphy. As its name implies, the Regular Script is regular, with each stroke placed slowly and carefully on the paper. The structure of the Regular Script is rigorous, with square shapes and straight strokes. There are no links between the structures of characters, and each stroke is independent. As a result, the script as a whole looks very regular and gives a stable and dignified visual experience.<br />
<br />
The four great calligraphers of the early Tang - Ouyang Xun, Yu Shinan, Chu Suiliang and Xue Ji - were all known for their regular script. Depending on the size of the characters, the Regular Script is further divided into larger regular script , medium regular script and small regular script. Regular characters with a width (or length) larger than 5 cm are usually considered larger regular script, while those smaller than 2 cm are usually called small regular script. Those in between is the medium regular script.<br />
